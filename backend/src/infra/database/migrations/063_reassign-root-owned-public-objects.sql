-- Migration: 063 - Reassign root-owned public objects to project_admin, durably
--
-- Migration 046 transferred existing public objects to project_admin as a
-- one-time sweep, but root execution paths that remained after it — the
-- unrestricted raw SQL endpoint (used by `insforge create` template init and
-- `db query --unrestricted`) and superuser restores — keep creating public
-- objects owned by the superuser. Custom migrations and restricted raw SQL
-- run as project_admin, so any later ALTER on those objects fails with
-- "must be owner of table <name>".
--
-- This migration wraps the 046 sweep in a reusable function and runs it once
-- to repair databases broken since 046. The backend calls the same function
-- after every unrestricted DDL statement so ownership can no longer drift.
